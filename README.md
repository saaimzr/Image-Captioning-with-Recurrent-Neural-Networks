# Image-Captioning-with-Recurrent-Neural-Networks
 An image captioning project using RNN, LSTM, and attention-based models to generate descriptive, context-aware captions for images. Leveraging the COCO Captions dataset, this project demonstrates skills in neural networks, computer vision, and NLP with attention-enhanced captioning for accurate results.
